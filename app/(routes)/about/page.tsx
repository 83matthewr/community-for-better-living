              The Community for Better Living began in the early 2000s with the challenge of
              becoming a beacon of help and guidance. We started by offering classes in healthy
              cooking, CPR, autism awareness, financial planning, online identity protection, healthy,
              judgment-free spirituality, and anything else we found to help the community.
              Importantly, all our classes have always been accessible to the public, ensuring
              everyone in our community can benefit and live better, more fulfilling lives.<br /><br />

              In 2010, we settled at our current location off Columbia Rd. Meanwhile, a sister
              organization, Walk of Faith Community Center, began to pay its roots on the west side
              of Cleveland, partnering with the Greater Cleveland Food Bank to serve that area as a
              pantry distribution center and hot breakfast for anyone in need.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph attrs="basis-1/2">
              In 2014, both centers drew a bit closer as they began to share the same board chair
              and director, and in 2016, at the urging of the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, the
              Community for Better Living began food pantry service on the second and fourth
              Thursdays of the month. Shortly after that, the Walk of Faith Community Center lost its
              lease, and the two centers merged and became the Community for Better Living. We
              continue to run food pantry services twice a month and hold classes and events to help
              enrich our community. All are welcome to join any of our services and become a part of
              our community.

            The Community for Better Living strives to enrich the lives of our community members
            in many ways. We offer a food pantry to help those in need, host fun and engaging
            family events, provide educational classes on various topics, and even have a weekly
            spiritual group that meets on Saturdays.<br /><br />
            Our services and events wouldn&#39;t be possible without our incredible team of passionate
            volunteers dedicated to serving others. Their hearts and hard work are the backbone of
            the CBL mission. We operate with transparency, integrity, and accountability in
            everything we do, holding ourselves to the highest standards. Financial support comes
            through grants and contributions from compassionate donors who share our vision of a
            better community.
